      <h1>Are you planning on adopting a Pet? This is our guide to adoption</h1>
      <div>
        <p>
Every furry friend deserves to feel safe, respected, and loved. That's why we're on a mission to ensure that all pets in need of a home find the perfect match.

Before diving into the adoption process, we recommend checking if you're ready and learning how to properly care for your chosen pet. 

Because the well-being of our furry pals is our top priority, we've laid down some rules and recomendations. Some of these apply to everyone, while others depend on the type of pet you want to adopt. These guidelines not only protect our pets but also help you figure out if you're truly ready to embrace the joy of adoption.

  <h2>What type of pet should I have?</h2>
  <p>Based on your daily habits and lifestyle</p>
<div>
<h3>Lifestyle and Activity Level:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Dogs: If you lead an active lifestyle and enjoy outdoor activities such as walking, running, or playing fetch, a dog may be a great fit. Dogs typically require daily exercise and mental stimulation.</li>
  <li>Cats: If you prefer a more independent and low-maintenance companion, a cat might be the right choice. Cats are generally more self-sufficient and require less exercise compared to dogs.</li>
  <li>Smaller Animals: If you have limited space or prefer a pet that requires minimal exercise, smaller animals like hamsters, guinea pigs, or rabbits can be suitable options.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Time and Attention:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Dogs: Dogs thrive on human interaction and companionship. They require regular feeding, exercise, grooming, and training. If you can dedicate time to training and socializing a dog, they can be incredibly loyal and loving companions.</li>
  <li>Cats: Cats are generally more self-sufficient and can adapt well to a more independent lifestyle. They still require feeding, playtime, and affection, but they are often more low-maintenance compared to dogs.</li>
  <li>Smaller Animals: Smaller animals usually require less time and attention compared to dogs and cats. However, they still need proper care, including regular feeding, cleaning their habitats, and providing social interaction.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Living Arrangements:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Dogs: Consider your living situation and whether you have access to outdoor space, such as a yard or nearby parks. Some dog breeds require more space and are better suited for houses with yards, while others can adapt well to apartment living.</li>
  <li>Cats: Cats are generally more adaptable to various living environments. They can thrive in apartments as long as they have enough space for play, scratching posts, and litter boxes.</li>
  <li>Smaller Animals: Smaller animals like hamsters, guinea pigs, or rabbits require appropriate enclosures or cages. Make sure you have enough space to accommodate their habitat and keep them safe.</li>
</ul>
